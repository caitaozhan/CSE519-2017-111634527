# Data Science Fundamentals



# **Homework-2**

The jupyter notebook is at HW2/HW2.ipynb. 

And The report is at HW2/report.pdf

**Note** that I restructured the repository on Oct. 3rd. So the latest timestamp of all the files in HW2/ will be on Oct. 3rd.

# **Homework-3**
Three members of our team:

1. Xuan Xu, 111675940
2. Hae-Na Lee, 111207004
3. Caitao Zhan, 111634527.


# **The Project**

I need much more than a title.   I need enough evidence that you know what you are going to do that I am reassured that you will be able to complete the project without hitting obvious roadblocks.    This means I need to be convinced that:
 
-- You understand the problem/domain, by having done background research/reading.
 
-- That you know where the data for your project is, not just a website that purportedly has it but that you know the number of records and what fields are available and ideally have played with it enough to know how good it is for your purpose.
 
-- That you have a clear idea of what to do next on your project, for your progress report.
 
-- That you have a clear idea of how to evaluate what you will be doing.
 
This is why the writeup should be 3-5 pages.
